# CO₂ Emission Prediction

This project implements a predictive modeling system to estimate vehicle CO₂ emissions based on vehicle and engine characteristics. The solution applies both machine learning and deep learning approaches to model the relationship between input features and emission levels, supporting analytical assessment and decision-making in environmental and automotive contexts.

The project focuses on building, evaluating, and comparing multiple regression-based models to capture nonlinear patterns in emissions data. The resulting predictive models are integrated into a lightweight web interface to demonstrate how trained models can be exposed for interactive inference, highlighting the practical deployment of data-driven models for real-world environmental analytics applications.
